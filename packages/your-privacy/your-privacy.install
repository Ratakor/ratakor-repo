  The 'your-privacy' package detects other packages on your system,
  which are known to support privacy-unsafe protocols/services,
  and protects you from (accidentally) installing those in the future.

  Also, as any other such packages are identified in the future,
  an updated 'your-privacy' package will prompt you for their removal.

  Your feedback/participation is important. It is _your_ privacy, after all.
  If you notice any problems caused by this package, or notice some package
  which does or does not deserve to be guarded, please do start a discussion.
